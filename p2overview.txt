Problem -- 1 page -- Describes the problem identified to be solved. For research project this will be a detailed description of issue or failure to be researched.

Problem - Anyone can write a program or design a system, but how does one ensure the quality of the product so that it works.



The worst bugs are system bugs which originate from assumption made by individual authors of different components.




Solution - Desiging the bugs out


Specified product defintion

A thoroughly designed Product defintion is important to prevent system bugs. Since most of these bugs are due to unspecified defintion of functions.


Structured programming

One way to avoid bugs is to adhere to Dijstrak's theory of Structured programming	

In strucured programming programs are composed of the following control structures.
Sequences - Statements exectued one after the other
Selection - an if else statement
Iteration - Do while loop
Recursion - A function calls itself until a certain condition is met.


Testing the bugs out-
